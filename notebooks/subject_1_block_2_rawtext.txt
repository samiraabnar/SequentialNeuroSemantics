" Give that here , Malfoy ," said Harry quietly . Everyone stopped talking to watch . + Malfoy smiled nastily . " I think I ' ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree ?" + " Give it @ here !" Harry yelled , but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off . He hadn ' t been lying , he @ could fly well . Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called , " Come and get it , Potter !" + Harry grabbed his broom . + @" No !" shouted Hermione Granger . " Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you ' ll get us all into trouble ." + Harry ignored her . Blood was pounding in his ears . He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up , up he soared ; air rushed through his hair , and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he ' d found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy , this was @ wonderful . He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher , and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron . + He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair . + Malfoy looked stunned . " Give it here ," Harry called , " or I ' ll knock you off that broom !" + " Oh , yeah ?" said Malfoy , trying to sneer , but looking worried . + Harry knew , somehow , what to do . He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands , and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin . Malfoy only just got out of the way in time ; Harry made a sharp about - face and held the broom steady . A few people below were clapping . + " No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck , Malfoy ," Harry called . + The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy . + " Catch it if you can , then !" he shouted , and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground . + Harry saw , as though in slow motion , the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall . He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive , racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears , mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it , just in time to pull his broom straight , and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist . + " HARRY POTTER !" + His heart sank faster than he ' d just dived . Professor McGonagall was running toward them . He got to his feet , trembling . + @" Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts " Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock , and her glasses flashed furiously , " how @ dare you -- might have broken your neck " + " It wasn ' t his fault , Professor " + " Be quiet , Miss Patil " + " But Malfoy " " That ' s enough , Mr . Weasley . Potter , follow me , now ." + Harry caught sight of Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle ' s triumphant faces as he left , walking numbly in Professor McGonagall ' s wake as she strode toward the castle . He was going to be expelled , he just knew it . He wanted to say something to defend himself , but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice . Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him ; he had to jog to keep up . Now he ' d done it . He hadn ' t even lasted two weeks . He ' d be packing his bags in ten minutes . What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep ? + Up the front steps , up the marble staircase inside , and still Professor McGonagall didn ' t say a word to him . She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her . Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore . He thought of Hagrid , expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper . Perhaps he could be Hagrid ' s assistant . His stomach twisted as he imagined it , watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid ' s bag . + Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom . She opened the door and poked her head inside . + " Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ?" + Wood ? thought Harry , bewildered ; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him ? But Wood turned out to be a person , a burly fifth - year boy who came out of Flitwick ' s class looking confused . + " Follow me , you two ," said Professor McGonagall , and they marched on up the corridor , Wood looking curiously at Harry . + " In here ." + Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves , who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard . + " Out , Peeves !" she barked . Peeves threw the chalk into a bin , which clanged loudly , and he swooped out cursing . Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys . + " Potter , this is Oliver Wood . Wood -- I ' ve found you a Seeker ." + Wood ' s expression changed from puzzlement to delight . + " Are you serious , Professor ?" + " Absolutely ," said Professor McGonagall crisply . " The boy ' s a natural . I ' ve never seen anything like it . Was that your first time on a broomstick , Potter ?" + Harry nodded silently . He didn ' t have a clue what was going on , but he didn ' t seem to be being expelled , and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs . + " He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty - foot dive ," Professor McGonagall told Wood . " Didn ' t even scratch himself . Charlie Weasley couldn ' t have done it ." + Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once . + " Ever seen a game of Quidditch , Potter ?" he asked excitedly . + " Wood ' s captain of the Gryffindor team ," Professor McGonagall explained . + " He ' s just the build for a Seeker , too ," said Wood , now walking around Harry and staring at him . " Light -- speedy -- we ' ll have to get him a decent broom , Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven , I ' d say ." + " I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can ' t bend the first - year rule . Heaven knows , we need a better team than last year . Flattened in that last match by Slytherin , I couldn ' t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks . ." + Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry . + " I want to hear you ' re training hard , Potter , or I may change my mind about punishing you ." + Then she suddenly smiled . + " Your father would have been proud ," she said . " He was an excellent Quidditch player himself ." + + " You ' re @ joking ." + It was dinnertime . Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he ' d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall . Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth , but he ' d forgotten all about it . + @" Seeker ?" he said . " But first years @ never -- you must be the youngest House player in about " + " a century ," said Harry , shoveling pie into his mouth . He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon . " Wood told me ." + Ron was so amazed , so impressed , he just sat and gaped at Harry . + " I start training next week ," said Harry . " Only don ' t tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret ." + Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall , spotted Harry , and hurried over . + " Well done ," said George in a low voice . " Wood told us . We ' re on the team too -- Beaters ." + " I tell you , we ' re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year ," said Fred . " We haven ' t won since Charlie left , but this year ' s team is going to be brilliant . You must be good , Harry , Wood was almost skipping when he told us ." + " Anyway , we ' ve got to go , Lee Jordan reckons he ' s found a new secret passageway out of the school ." + " Bet it ' s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . See you ." +
