Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley , but that was before he met Draco Malfoy . Still , first - year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins , so they didn ' t have to put up with Malfoy much . Or at least , they didn ' t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan . Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together . + " Typical ," said Harry darkly . " Just what I always wanted . To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy ." + He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else . " You don ' t know that you ' ll make a fool of yourself ," said Ron reasonably . " Anyway , I know Malfoy ' s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch , but I bet that ' s all talk ." + Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot . He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long , boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters . He wasn ' t the only one , though : the way Seamus Finnigan told it , he ' d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick . Even Ron would tell anyone who ' d listen about the time he ' d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie ' s old broom . Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly . Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas , who shared their dormitory , about soccer . Ron couldn ' t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly . Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean ' s poster of West Ham soccer team , trying to make the players move . + Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life , because his grandmother had never let him near one . Privately , Harry felt she ' d had good reason , because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground . + Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was . This was something you couldn ' t learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn ' t tried . At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she ' d gotten out of a library book called @ Quidditch @ Through @ the @ Ages . Neville was hanging on to her every word , desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later , but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione ' s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail . + Harry hadn ' t had a single letter since Hagrid ' s note , something that Malfoy had been quick to notice , of course . Malfoy ' s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home , which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table . + A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother . He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble , which seemed to be full of white smoke . + " It ' s a Remembrall !" he explained . " Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there ' s something you ' ve forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh " His face fell , because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet , " you ' ve forgotten something " + Neville was trying to remember what he ' d forgotten when Draco Malfoy , who was passing the Gryffindor table , snatched the Remembrall out of his hand . + Harry and Ron jumped to their feet . They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy , but Professor McGonagall , who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school , was there in a flash . + " What ' s going on ?" + " Malfoy ' s got my Remembrall , Professor ." + Scowling , Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table . + " Just looking ," he said , and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him . + + At three - thirty that afternoon , Harry , Ron , and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson . It was a clear , breezy day , and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth , flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest , whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance . + The Slytherins were already there , and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground . Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms , saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high , or always flew slightly to the left . + Their teacher , Madam Hooch , arrived . She had short , gray hair , and yellow eyes like a hawk . + " Well , what are you all waiting for ?" she barked . " Everyone stand by a broomstick . Come on , hurry up ." + Harry glanced down at his broom . It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles . + " Stick out your right hand over your broom ," called Madam Hooch at the front , " and say Up !'" + " UP !" everyone shouted . + Harry ' s broom jumped into his hand at once , but it was one of the few that did . Hermione Granger ' s had simply rolled over on the ground , and Neville ' s hadn ' t moved at all . Perhaps brooms , like horses , could tell when you were afraid , thought Harry ; there was a quaver in Neville ' s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground . + Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end , and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips . Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he ' d been doing it wrong for years . + " Now , when I blow my whistle , you kick off from the ground , hard ," said Madam Hooch . " Keep your brooms steady , rise a few feet , and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly . On my whistle -- three -- two " + But Neville , nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground , pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch ' s lips . + " Come back , boy !" she shouted , but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet . Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away , saw him gasp , slip sideways off the broom and -- + WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap . His broomstick was still rising higher and higher , and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight . + Madam Hooch was bending over Neville , her face as white as his . " Broken wrist ," Harry heard her mutter . " Come on , boy -- it ' s all right , up you get ." + She turned to the rest of the class . " None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing ! You leave those brooms where they are or you ' ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch .' Come on , dear ." + Neville , his face tear - streaked , clutching his wrist , hobbled off with Madam Hooch , who had her arm around him . + No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter . + " Did you see his face , the great lump ?" + The other Slytherins joined in . + " Shut up , Malfoy ," snapped Parvati Patil . + " Ooh , sticking up for Longbottom ?" said Pansy Parkinson , a hard - faced Slytherin girl . " Never thought @ you ' d like fat little crybabies , Parvati ." + " Look !" said Malfoy , darting forward and snatching something out of the grass . " It ' s that stupid thing Longbottom ' s gran sent him ." + The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up . +
